# Replica App UI

## What is Replica App UI?

This package is the UI Toolkit implementation of the [App UI Design System](https://silver-spork-892c29ad.pages.github.io/).
It is intended to use this package in runtime apps development.

* **Platform Agnostic:** App UI aims to create high quality experience that effortlessly scale across platforms and mediums. Ranging from Web/Desktop to Mobile and Spatial interfaces.
* **Reduce Complexity:** App UI’s components and patterns help solve problems that come up time and time again. Consider employing patterns within App UI to improve consistency and scalability across runtime apps.
* **Follow Code Structure:** App UI’s components map directly to how they should be built out in code. Aim to leave no room for ambiguity or confusion when it comes to implementation.
* **Prevent Double Handling:** App UI provides a suite of consistent and implementable UI patterns right out of the box, leaving more time to solve problems for runtime app users.
* **Reduce Visual Noise:** App UI’s components have been designed to reduce visual noise and allow the user to focus on the task at hand.
* **Be Replaceable:** Aim to establish processes that are open and sustainable over time. Prevent bottlenecks and single points of failure where possible. By doing so, App UI will remain up to date and open to all.
