# My Unity Cloud Platform Sample Project
Introduce your sample project and explain what it is intended to help users understand and accomplish. It can be helpful to link from this paragraph to sections of Unity Editor Manual documentation with information that is outside the scope of your project, but still relevant.

After reading your introduction, a user should know whether or not your sample project is relevant or interesting to them.

Helpful questions you can use for writing prompts include:

* Why would someone want to play with your sample project?
* What is it supposed to demonstrate?
* Who is it supposed to be super interesting to?
* Which pain points or unintuitive parts of your feature does the sample project show users how to get through?
* What can users gain from their experience with your sample project?
* Prerequisites and system requirements
* What does a user need to have before they can install and use your sample project? For example, do they need a:
	* Special license
	* Particular version of the Unity Editor
	* Permissions or a particular type of user account with valid credentials
	* Project already set up
	* Set of packages already installed
	* Operating system
	* Graphics card or other hardware
	* Companion animal

## Installation
Describe the basic things a user needs to do to get to a point where they are able to open the sample project without an intimidating number of warnings.

After you summarize the process, write the exact steps for completing installation activities here:

1. Do the first thing.
2. Do the second thing.
3. Keep it up.
4. (optional) If you really want to, you can do this thing.
5. Validate that you did the thing correctly by doing this.

A successful outcome typically looks like this:
