# Glossary

What non-basic terms does the documentation reference? Non-basic terms are terminology that we can't assume the user already knows the definition of.

List the terms in alphabetical order. Include anchors beside each term heading so you can link to the term from other sections of the documentation.

## <a name="AnchorName">Term 1</a>

First, check if this term is already defined in the [Unity User Manual Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Glossary.html).
