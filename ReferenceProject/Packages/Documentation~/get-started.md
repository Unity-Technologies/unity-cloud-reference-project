# Get started

This section explains how to open a project that will use your feature and start doing cool things with it.

At the end of this section, a user should know where everything they need to be successful with your feature is located, and be ready to follow any instructions on accomplishing use cases.

## Verifying project settings

Are there any project or editor settings that the user needs to modify or verify before they can do cool stuff? Describe them, and then offer specific instructions!

## Identifying new content

Tell me things like:

* What new things can they see that they havenâ€™t seen before?
* What kinds of GameObjects or assets should they pay attention to?
* Are there special scripts that they need to add?

## Do any other settings, configurations, license issues, JSON files, accounts, or integrations need attention before we get to work?
